The purpose of the Mid America Entomological Archive database
is to mantain information about specimens collected by entomologists. The Entomological data 
will be supplied to inquirers via this database.

Comments: Good. This is nice an high-level. You can also be a little more broad. You are supplying information, yes, but you can allude to your goals in doing so; providing information that can support the safety, comfort and interests of everyone who is impacted by insects.
