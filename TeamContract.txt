TEAM CONTRACT

PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT:

The purpose of this contract is to help you and your team decide how to manage
your team project for this class. Particularly, how you will meet, and how you 
will collaborate on code, and how you will communicate. 

Please meet regularly as a team.  I suggest that you use a recurring in person, 
meeting for this. Video or conference calls may be appropriate if one or more 
team members are traveling (e.g., for athletic competition).  It is especially 
important that each member be present for the initial meeting. 

Discuss a strategy for working on the project.  In the first phase, you will 
design the database together (field specifications, ER diagrams, table 
descriptions, etc.).  The second phase is implementation (SQL, PHP, and HTML). 
You may need to adjust your strategy as you move from the first phase to the 
second; modify this contract accordingly, committing the agreed-upon changes to 
your Git repository containing this document.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Create a repository for your team on GitHub (https://github.com/).
Call it csc362-proj-[TERM][YR]-[YOUR TEAM NAME].  Where [TERM] is either "Fall" 
or "Spring", and [YR] is the last two digits of the current year. This 
repository must be different from your labs. As usual, add me as a collaborator 
with pull and push access.  This time also add all other members of the team. 
You should edit this contract on one computer and then commit it to git, where 
each of you can sign your name in a separate commit.

Decide on a regular meeting time--at least one regular meeting per week. Come 
to a consensus on when and how. Be realistic. If you cannot be attend, discuss 
this openly as a team.  Also consider the schedule for the term project and how 
it relates to your other commitments (classes, clubs, sports, religious 
activities, etc.)  If there will be points during the semester when it will be 
difficult or impossible for you to contribute to the project, you should discuss
this as a team.  For example, you may want to decide now that you will
need to submit a particular deliverable early.

If you make changes to this contract, all team members should come to
agreement. Then commit the revised contract via git.

AGREED MEETING TIME/PLACE/LINK FOR REGULAR WEEKLY TEAM MEETINGS/WORK:

OUR PLAN FOR SUBMITTING THE DELIVERABLES: Do them in the order listed and put them on github. 

[Note: The deadlines are listed below, and it is OK to leave these
unchanged.  However, your team may need to submit one or more
deliverables early due to your team members' constraints and other
commitments.  Of course, you could also choose as a team to submit a
deliverable late--but keep in mind that this will result in a reduced
score of 10 points (out of 100) per day or part of a day late.  The
reason for the penalty is to help teams stay on track and have greater
success in completing the project as a whole.]
